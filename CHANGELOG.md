# Next version (unreleased)

- Records are now rooted per operation type (QUERY_ROOT, MUTATION_ROOT, SUBSCRIPTION_ROOT) (#109)
- `ApolloClient.apolloStore` is deprecated in favor of `ApolloClient.store` for consistency.
- Individual `ApolloStore` methods no longer accept a `CustomScalarAdapters`. Instead it can be passed to the `ApolloStore` constructor.
- `ApolloClient.apolloStore` now returns a `SimpleApolloStore`, a wrapper around `ApolloStore` that doesn't need a `CustomScalarAdapters` to be passed to read/write methods.

# Version 0.0.8
_2025-03-28_

- Storage binary format is changed to be a bit more compact
- Add `ApolloStore.trim()` to remove old data from the cache
- `CacheKey` is used in more APIs instead of `String`, for consistency.
- `ApolloCacheHeaders.EVICT_AFTER_READ` is removed. `ApolloStore.remove()` can be used instead.
- `NormalizedCache.remove(pattern: String)` is removed. Please open an issue if you need this feature back.
